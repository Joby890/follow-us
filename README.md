A quick and dirty utility script that follows all members in an organization.

## What it does

* You enter you GitHub login credentials.
* You enter the name of a GitHub organisation.
* The script follows all the members of the organization you entered.

## For really lazy people

```
npm i -g follow-us && follow-us
```

## Disclaimer

I hacked on this for about ~15 minutes after forking.
